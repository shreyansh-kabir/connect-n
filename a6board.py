"""
The gameboard for the Connect-N game.

This module keeps the board state of the game. This game supports R rows, C columns, and
a requirement of N in a line to win.  Traditionally, all of these values are fixed to:

    R == 6
    C == 7
    N == 4

Our version of the game allows variations on some or all of these parameters.
